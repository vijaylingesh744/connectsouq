                directory is the simplest way in which one can bid on a link, or a few
                links if they wish to do so. The link directory on MTA displays all of
                the links it currently has, and does so in alphabetical order, which
                makes it much easier for someone to find what they are looking for if
                it is something specific and they do not want to go through all the
                other sites and links as well. It allows you to start your bid at the
                bottom and slowly work your way to the top of the list.
